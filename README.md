# DRONE

Developed from the base of Hands-on rust, a book i recommend for anyone getting into rust with an already established programming background.

Through the book I got to develop my own dungeon crawler rogulike game! This is the result. Some extra implementations i did after finishing the book were
- Adventure Log
- New enemy variety 
- New items
- Decals on map for decoration
- Webassembly build (!!!)
- New graphics (made by Emil Bertholdsson)

[You can play the game on itch.io](https://davidstyrbjorn.itch.io/drone)
